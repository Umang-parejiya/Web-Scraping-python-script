        "description": "10 turn calibration. Very simply, the 400 series is a turns-counting dial without compromise. It is the standard for the industry. This dial is by far our most popular turns-counting dial. The 400 series dial has a patented positive-transfer turning mechanism that allows it to be smooth and responsive to the user. The operator experiences absolutely zero backlash, because the base unit with the index line and the brake assembly are secured to the panel without locating lugs and additional holes. The dial reveals distinctive, easy to read primary and secondary scales. The 400, 500 and 600 series requires only 1 square inch of panel space and mounts on true 1 inch centers. Models are available for 1/4\", 1/8\", 3/32\" and metric shaft configuarations. Models are available with or without brakes. Shaft Extension beyond face of panel: .600″ Min./.800″ Max./.725″ Optimum Pot. Bushing Extension beyond face of panel: .125″ Min. thread (full thread)/.297″ Max. Maximum Weight: .65oz/18 gram",
